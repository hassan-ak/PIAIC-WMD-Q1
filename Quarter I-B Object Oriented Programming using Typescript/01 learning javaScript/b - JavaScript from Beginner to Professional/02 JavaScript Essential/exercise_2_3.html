      Write some code to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using the
      Pythagorean theorem when given the values of the other two sides. The
      theorem specifies that the relation between the sides of a right-angled
      triangle is a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> .

      You can use prompt() to get the value for a and b. Write code to get the
      value from the user for a and b. Then square the values of both a and b
      before adding them together and finding the square root. Print your answer
      to the console.
