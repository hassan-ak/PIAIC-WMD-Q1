  Introducing concurrency
    - Concurrency is whenever things are happening "at the same time" or in parallel
    - Dinner exapmle
      - stater
      - main
      - dessert
      - tea
    - we can do a call to some API and not wait for the reply but do something
    useful in the meantime instead. We can do so using the concept of concurrency
    - three strategies
      - callbacks,
      - Promises,
      - async and await keywords
