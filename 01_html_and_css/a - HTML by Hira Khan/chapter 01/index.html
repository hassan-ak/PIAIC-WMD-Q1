<!-- Summary -->
<!-- HTML pages are documents that contain text -->
<!-- HTML uses tags, which act like containers and tell you about the information which lies between their opening and closing tags -->
<!-- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content -->
<!-- Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to render the content of the pages -->
<!-- Usually we refer to tags as elements -->
<!-- Tags usually come in pairs. Our content is usually contained within the opening and closing tags. The opening tag marks the beginning of the content and the closing tag marks the end.  -->
<!-- Every HTML element can have predefined attributes Attributes provide additional information about the content of an element, they appear on the opening tag and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, seprated by the equal sign. -->
<!-- To learn HTML you need to know the different tags available for use, what functionalities they provide to our website and where they are positioned in our HTML code -->
