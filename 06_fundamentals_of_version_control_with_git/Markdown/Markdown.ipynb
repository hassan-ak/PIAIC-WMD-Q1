Markdown can be created or edited in any text editor and saved with an extension \".md\". [DILLINGER](https://dillinger.io/) can be used to edit and preview Markdown files in real time. On GitHub markdown files are saved as README.md and it is automatically displayed in the repository. Markdown files can also be edited and previewed on GitHub.\n",
