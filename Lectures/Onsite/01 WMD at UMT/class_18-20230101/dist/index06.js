//----
//A confusion about Structural Typing:
//Please Read https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5303
//Object literals have an associated freshness before they're
//bound to a variable.
//The same doesn't apply for any other expressions.
//The idea is that object literals are often used for option bags
//(where the user has to manually type out each property
//name at each use-site), and this behavior catches typos.
//If you'd like to prevent Animal from being assigned to a Human,
//you can add a private property to Animal,
//since private and protected properties need to originate from
//the same declaration to be compatible.
//----
class Human {
    name;
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
//----
class Animal {
    name;
    age;
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    eat(quantity) {
        console.log(this.name + ' is a Human and is eating');
    }
}
//----
let d = { name: 'Hello', age: 4 };
let h = { name: 'hello' }; // This is allowed
let h1 = d; // Concept of stale object applied here
//----
//Its false, because we have assigned object literal and
//assignment works because of structural typing
let isHuman = h instanceof Human;
console.log(isHuman); // false
//----
//This is not allowed need to add all properties
//including functions
// fresh object assignment
// properties or methods missing
// let a1: Animal = { name: 'Cat', age: 4 };
//----
// This below statement is allowed
// Note there is no parameter in function and it does not give
// any compilation error but you can not call
// this function without paramter, see the call below
let a2 = {
    name: 'Dog',
    age: 4,
    eat: function () {
        console.log('Eat in object literal');
    },
};
// Maps to class methods need some argument
// a2.eat(); // Not allowed
a2.eat(3); // Works fine
//----
let isAnimal = a2 instanceof Animal;
console.log(isAnimal); // What will be printed?
export {};
