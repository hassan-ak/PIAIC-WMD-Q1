# Step 3: The Golden Code

Your final task, given you agree to tackle it, is to develop a `createCodeCracker` function.
It should take an object of settings as described below.
It will return a function that, when given a code, repeatedly makes a guess and checks the guess for validity.
We will use it to break into the secret messages used by S.C.R.I.P.T.E.R. and defeat them once and for all!

## Specification

Parameters:

1. An object with the following properties:

- `attempts`: How many code cracking attempts should be made
- `makeGuess`: A function that has...
  - Parameters:
    1. `text`: Any string
    2. `attempt`: Which number attempt is happening
  - Return: A string to use as a guess
- `validateGuess`: A function that has...
  - Parameters:
    1. `guess`: Any string
  - Return: Whether the guess was correct

Return: a function with:

- Parameters:
  1. `text`: Any string
- Return: The first guess generated by calling `makeGuess` where `validateGuess` returned `true`, or `undefined` if none ever did

## How to test the solution

1. Setup the environemt

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects learning-typescript-projects
   cd learning-typescript-projects
   npm i
   ```

2. Naviagte to the project directory using

   ```cmd
   cd projects/functions/secret-secrets
   ```

3. run following commands

   ```cmd
   npm run tsc -- --project 03-the-golden-code --watch
   npm run test -- 1 --watch
   ```

4. Open an other terminal and nviagte to the directory

   ```cmd
   03-the-golden-code
   ```

5. Copy `index.ts` from this project to the directory opened in step 4
