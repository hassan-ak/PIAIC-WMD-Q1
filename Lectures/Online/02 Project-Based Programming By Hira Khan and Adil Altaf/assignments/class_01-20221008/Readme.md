## Question 01

- Miles-to-kilometers converter (vice versa)
  - Create a variable that contains a value in miles, convert it to kilometers, and log the value in kilometers in the following format:
    ```
    The distance of 130 kms is equal to 209.2142 miles
    ```
  - For reference, 1 mile equals 1.60934 kilometers.

## Question 02

- BMI calculator
  - Set values for height in inches and weight in pounds, then convert the values to centimeters and kilos, outputting the results to the console:
    - 1 inch is equal to 2.54 cm
    - 2.2046 pounds is equal to 1 kilo
  - Output the results. Then, calculate and log the BMI: this is equal to weight (in kilos) divided by squared height (in meters). Output the results to the console
