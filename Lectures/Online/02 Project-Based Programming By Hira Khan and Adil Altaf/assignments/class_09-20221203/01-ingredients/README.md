# Step 1: Ingredients

- The first area of code I'll need you to fix is my ingredients planner.
- I use this to print what kind of salad greens and dressings to use for meals.
- Again, the runtime code is working fine.
- It's just the type annotations you'll need to correct.

## How to test the solution

1. Setup the environemt

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects learning-typescript-projects
   cd learning-typescript-projects
   npm i
   ```

2. Naviagte to the project directory using

   ```cmd
   cd projects/unions-and-literals/primitive-cooking
   ```

3. run following commands

   ```cmd
   npm run tsc -- --project 01-ingredients --watch
   ```

4. Open an other terminal and nviagte to the directory

   ```cmd
   01-ingredients
   ```

5. Copy `index.ts` from this project to the directory opened in step 4
