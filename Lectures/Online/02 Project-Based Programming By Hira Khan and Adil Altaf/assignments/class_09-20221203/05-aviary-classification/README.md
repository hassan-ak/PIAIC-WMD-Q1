# Step 1: Aviary Classification

- As a world-renowned expert in bird law, it is my duty to properly educate the court on the characteristics of various birds and related bird information.
- I cannot uphold my critical task if my bird files are not in proper order.
- I require you to write an object type describing a `Bird` type for my array of birds.
- Please be as specific as possible for types when possible.
- Any property other than `name` whose values are strings should be a union of unions of string literals.
