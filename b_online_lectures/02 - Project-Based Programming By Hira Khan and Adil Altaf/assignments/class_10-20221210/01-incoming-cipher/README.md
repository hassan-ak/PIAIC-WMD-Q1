# Step 1: Incoming Cipher

Your assignment, assuming you opt into it, is to develop a `createCipher` function.
Its sole parameter should be a "cipher" function that takes in a string and returns a string.
Its return type should be a function that takes in a string and returns the result of calling that cipher on each character of the string.

> Tip: you can loop over a string a `for...of`

## Specification

Parameters:

1. `cipher`: A function that takes in a string and returns another string

Return: a function with:

- Parameters:
  1. `text`: Any string
- Return type: A string generated by calling `cipher` on every character of `text`

## How to test the solution

1. Setup the environemt

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects learning-typescript-projects
   cd learning-typescript-projects
   npm i
   ```

2. Naviagte to the project directory using

   ```cmd
   cd projects/functions/secret-secrets
   ```

3. run following commands

   ```cmd
   npm run tsc -- --project 01-incoming-cipher --watch
   npm run test -- 1 --watch
   ```

4. Open an other terminal and nviagte to the directory

   ```cmd
   01-incoming-cipher
   ```

5. Copy `index.ts` from this project to the directory opened in step 4
