# Step 2: Dr. On

Your undertaking, if you decide to undertake it, is to develop a `createAdvancedCipher` function.
It is similar to the previous `createCipher` function, but instead of taking in one function parameter, it takes in three.
One for vowels, one for consonants, and one for punctuation.

## Specification

Parameters:

1. `onVowel`: A function that takes in a string and returns another string
2. `onConsonant`: A function that takes in a string and returns another string
3. `onPunctuation`: A function that takes in a string and returns another string

Return: a function with:

- Parameters:
  1. `text`: Any string
- Return: A string generated by calling, on every character of `text`:
  - If the character is a vowel (`/[aeiou]/i`): `onVowel`
  - If the character is a consonant (`/[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]/i`): `onConsonant`
  - For any other character: `onPunctuation`

## Specification

Parameters:

1. `cipher`: A function that takes in a string and returns another string

Return: a function with:

- Parameters:
  1. `text`: Any string
- Return type: A string generated by calling `cipher` on every character of `text`

## How to test the solution

1. Setup the environemt

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects learning-typescript-projects
   cd learning-typescript-projects
   npm i
   ```

2. Naviagte to the project directory using

   ```cmd
   cd projects/functions/secret-secrets
   ```

3. run following commands

   ```cmd
   npm run tsc -- --project 02-dr-on --watch
   npm run test -- 1 --watch
   ```

4. Open an other terminal and nviagte to the directory

   ```cmd
   02-dr-on
   ```

5. Copy `index.ts` from this project to the directory opened in step 4
