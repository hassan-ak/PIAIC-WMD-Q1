## Question 01

- Manipulating an array

  - Take the following array:

    ```js
    const theList = [
      'Laurence',
      'Svekis',
      true,
      35,
      null,
      undefined,
      { test: 'one', score: 55 },
      ['one', 'two'],
    ];
    ```

  - Manipulate your array using various methods, such as pop(), push(), shift(), and unshift(), and transform it into the following:

    ```js
    ['FIRST', 'Svekis', 'MIDDLE', 'hello World', 'LAST'];
    ```

  - You can take the following steps, or adopt your own approach:
    - Remove the first item and the last item.
    - Add FIRST to the start of the array.
    - Assign hello World to the fourth item value.
    - Assign MIDDLE to the third index value.
    - Add LAST to the last position in the array.
    - Output it to the console.

## Question 02

- Company product catalog
  - In this project, you will implement a data structure for a product catalog and create queries to retrieve data.
    1. Create an array to hold an inventory of store items.
    2. Create three items, each having the properties of name, model, cost, and quantity.
    3. Add all three objects to the main array using an array method, and then log the inventory array to the console.
    4. Access the quantity element of your third item, and log it to the console.
    5. Experiment by adding and accessing more elements within your data structure.

## Question 03

- Evaluating a number game
  - Ask the user to enter a number and check whether it's greater than, equal to, or less than a dynamic number value in your code. Output the result to the user.

## Question 04

- Friend checker game
  - Ask the user to enter a name,
    using the switch statement to return a confirmation that the
    user is a friend if the name selected is known in the case statements.
    You can add a default response that you don't know the person if it's an unknown name.
    Output the result into the console.
