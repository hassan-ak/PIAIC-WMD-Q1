## Question 01

- Grid using for loop
  - Explore how to create a table grid that contains nested arrays as rows within a table. The rows will each contain the number of cells needed for the number of columns set in the variables. This grid table will dynamically adjust depending on the values for the variables.
    1. Create a grid array variable.
    2. Set a value of 64 for the number of cells.
    3. Set a counter to 0
    4. Create a global variable to be used for the row array.
    5. Create a loop that will iterate up to the number of cells you want in the array, plus one to include the zero value. In our example, we would use 64+1.
    6. Add an outer if statement, which uses modulo to check if the main counter is divisible by 8 or whatever number of columns you want.
    7. Inside the preceding if statement, add another if statement to check if the row is undefined, indicating whether it is the first run or whether the row is complete. If the row has been defined, then add the row to the main grid array.
    8. To finish off the outer if statement, if the counter is divisible by 8, clear the row arrayâ€”it has already been added to the grid by the inner if statement.
    9. At the end of the for loop, increment of the main counter by 1.
    10. Set up a temporary variable to hold the value of the counter and push it to the row array.
    11. Within the loop iteration, check if the value of the counter is equal to the total number of columns you want; if it is, then add the current row to the grid.
    12. Please note that the extra cell will not be added to the grid since there aren't enough cells to make a new row within the condition that adds the rows to the grid. An alternative solution would be to remove the +1 from the loop condition and add grid.push(row) after the loop is completed, both of which will provide the same solution output.
    13. Output the grid into the console.

## Question 02

- Looping over objects
  - In this exercise, we will experiment with looping over objects and internal arrays.
    1. Create a simple object with three items in it.
    2. Using the for in loop, get the properties' names and values from the object and output them into the console.
    3. Create an array containing the same three items. Using either the for loop or the for in loop, output the values from the array into the console.

## Question 03

- Math multiplication table
  - In this project, you will create a math multiplication table using loops. You can do this using your own creativity or by following some of the following suggested steps:
    1. Set up a blank array to contain the final multiplication table.
    2. Set a value variable to specify how many values you want to multiply with one another and show the results for.
    3. Create an outer for loop to iterate through each row and a temp array to store the row values. Each row will be an array of cells that will be nested into the final table.
    4. Add an inner for loop for the column values, which will push the multiplied row and column values to the temp array.
    5. Add the temporary row data that contains the calculated solutions to the main array of the final table. The final result will add a row of values for the calculations.
