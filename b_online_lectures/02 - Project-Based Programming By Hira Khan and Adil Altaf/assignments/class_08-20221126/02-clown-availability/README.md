# Step 2: Clown Availability

- The second and -thank heavens- final area of code I'll need you to fix is my clown assignment planner.
- I use this to print which clowns will be partying with which guests.
- Oh, and they introduced several unsettling clown puns in comments.
- It's because of those puns that I can't fix the code myself.
- The clowns again changed a few things around, but nothing more than an incorrect type annotation or different value for a variable.
- Could you please fix up the file to have no TypeScript complaints?

## How to test the solution

1. Setup the environemt

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects learning-typescript-projects
   cd learning-typescript-projects
   npm i
   ```

2. Naviagte to the project directory using

   ```cmd
   cd projects/the-type-system/system-of-a-clown
   ```

3. run following commands

   ```cmd
   npm run tsc -- --project 02-clown-availability --watch
   ```

4. Open an other terminal and nviagte to the directory

   ```cmd
   02-clown-availability
   ```

5. Copy `index.ts` from this project to the directory opened in step 4
